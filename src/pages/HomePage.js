        Hello! My name is Marcin. I started
        learning front-end in January 2019 with
        HTML and CSS. This project is my most
        extensive project, it shows what I have
        learned so far. The project is being
        developed, Currently, I am not focusing on
        the appearance but on the functionalities.
      </div>
    </>

export default HomePage;
